# Sports_management_System
The system allows for the creation, editing, and deletion of matches by an association manager. Matches are played by exactly two clubs, with one club being the host. Each match has a start time, end time, and allowed number of attendees. Each match is hosted at a specific stadium, which can be either available or not available. Once a match is approved, tickets can be purchased by fans to attend the match. The system also allows for the management of clubs, stadiums, and fans. A system admin can add or delete clubs, stadiums, and temporarily block fans from using the system. All users must log in with a user name and password to use the system.
